z3status - drop-in replacement for i3status
---

z3status is an alternate status bar for the i3-wm window manager. It is written in Zig, and is mostly a toy to see what can be done with Zig.


### Features

`z3status` aims to support the same features that `i3status` incorporates. Below is a list of metrics `z3status` will include by default. Crossed out features are yet to be implemented.

* date and time
* one minute process load average 
* memory used / memory available
* ~~partition space available~~
* ~~battery info (if available)~~
* ~~network information~~

### Build

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sleibrock/z3status && cd z3status
$ zig build -Drelease-small
```

### Motivations

The goal was to achieve some minimum-viable-program of `i3status` by writing a complete Zig program. `i3status` depends on a *lot* of dynamic libraries, and this lends itself to how flexible `i3status` can become if you configure it properly. The following text is all linked libraries by `i3status`.

```

Now some of these make sense (`libm`, `libc`, `libpthread`), but then you get weird things like... `libgpg-error`?

The flexibility of `i3status` is that it can be configured to show more than what it normally does by default, by adding a configuration to include these extended libraries. Showing your volume (`libalsa`, `libasound`, or `libpulsecommon`) exist to give your system the best compatibility in case you don't use a particular one. The media file libraries allow you to ... load media files? I guess? I'm shocked `libmpd` isn't here to interact with the `mpd` daemon, but oh well.

Naturally, you can't gauge a program based purely on it's dynamically-linked libraries; in fact, the performance of `i3status` is completely fine and has it's merits as it's been used for ages. It's byte-count isn't even that large, and it clocks in at a nice 105,280 bytes.

However, the code is rather dated and hard to read, as it's pure C language. Converting it to a Zig codebase allows for better porting and integration with the Zig build system. In some cases in the `i3status` code base there are even calls to `malloc()`, so my goal was to start learning and seeing how much of the code could be carried over, integrate with a generic `libc` ABI, remove memory allocations, and see how far I could get copying some basic functions over.
